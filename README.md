# cheatsheet_generator.nvim

A Neovim plugin for automatically generating comprehensive keymap cheatsheets in Markdown format.

> [!WARNING]
> This plugin is still a work in progress and is currently only guaranteed to work on neovim configurations that follow the Braintree neovim config structure. I wouldn't recommend trying this plugin out on your own config unless you're prepared for a lot of debugging and reorganization of your config!

## Features

- üîç **Comprehensive Detection**: Finds keymaps from built-in defaults, custom config, plugins, and ftplugins
- üìÅ **Configurable Paths**: Specify which directories and files to scan
- üîó **GitHub Integration**: Automatically generates links to source files with line numbers
- üéØ **Smart Categorization**: Groups keymaps by function, plugin, or custom categories
- ‚ö° **Fast Parsing**: Efficient static analysis of Lua plugin configurations
- üõ†Ô∏è **Extensible**: Plugin-specific fixes and custom post-processing

## Installation

### With [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
{
  "your-username/cheatsheet_generator.nvim",
  opts = {
    -- Configuration options (see below)
  },
  cmd = { "CheatsheetGenerate", "CheatsheetInstallHook" },
}
```

## Configuration

### Minimal Configuration

The plugin works out of the box with sensible defaults that assume the current neovim config uses lazy as a plugin manager. The default config assumes custom keymaps are located in `lua/config/keymaps.lua`, but this can be configured with the `config_keymap_files` option

### Full Configuration Example

```lua
require("cheatsheet_generator").setup({
  -- Where should the generator look for lazy plugin specs
  plugin_dirs = { "lua/plugins" }, 
  -- Where should the generator look for custom keymaps
  config_keymap_files = { "lua/config/keymaps.lua" },
  -- Manual keymap additions (optional)
  manual_keymaps = {
    ["telescope.nvim"] = {
      -- examples of custom actions to be included
      { keymap = "<C-t>", mode = "i", desc = "Scope to directory (with picker open)", source = "lua/plugins/telescope.lua" },
      { keymap = "d", mode = "n", desc = "Delete Buffer (in buffer explorer)", source = "lua/plugins/telescope.lua" },
    },
    ["nvim-tree.lua"] = {
      -- source is optional, but recommended
      { keymap = "a", mode = "n", desc = "Create file/directory" }, -- source defaults to "Manual addition"
    },
  },
  -- Built-in keymaps (uses plugin's built-in keymaps by default)
  built_in_keymaps = {
    enabled = true,
    -- change this if you want to use a different file for built in keymaps
    module = "cheatsheet_generator.built_in_keymaps", 
    -- change this to modify the display order of built in keymaps
    section_order = {
        "mode_changes",
        "motions",
        "edit_operations",
        "default_text_objects",
        "search",
        "insert_mode",
        "visual_mode",
        "macros_and_registers",
        "marks",
        "navigation",
        "folds",
    },
  },
  -- Git detection configuration
  git = {
    enabled = true, -- default behavior looks at your git repo to create source links
    default_branch = "main", -- the branch to use for source links
    base_url = nil, -- the base url to use for git links, leave nil to auto-detect 
  },
  -- Output configuration
  output = {
    file = "CHEATSHEET.md",
    title = "Neovim Keymap Cheatsheet",
    include_date = true,
    generation_info = {
      enabled = true,
    },
    runtime_note = {
      enabled = true,
      keymap_search = "<leader>sk", -- Optional: keymap for fuzzy search (only shown if set)
    },
  },
})
```

### Key Features

- **Automatic Defaults**: Works with zero configuration for standard Neovim setups
- **Built-in Keymaps**: Includes comprehensive built-in Neovim keymap definitions
- **Dynamic Notes**: Automatically generates documentation based on your configuration
- **Smart Detection**: Auto-detects Git repositories and file structures

### Manual Keymap Additions

The cheatsheet generator can only collect and parse keymaps that show up explicitly in your neovim config's plugin specs. Most plugins have built in keymaps that will not be included in the cheatsheet because they don't show up explicitly in your config. The `manual_keymaps` configuration attempts to remedy this by allowing you to manually specify keymaps that should be included in the cheatsheet. Adding entries here under specific plugin names will ensure that your manually added keymaps appear in the cheatsheet under the same grouping as the keymaps that came from that plugin's lazy plugin spec in your config.

#### Configuration Format

```lua
manual_keymaps = {
  ["plugin-name"] = {
    { keymap = "key", mode = "mode", desc = "description", source = "optional-source" },
    -- more keymaps...
  },
}
```

#### Field Requirements

- **`keymap`** (required): The key combination (e.g., `"<C-t>"`, `"<leader>ff"`, `"dd"`)
- **`mode`** (required): The mode(s) where this keymap is active (e.g., `"n"`, `"i"`, `"v"`)
- **`desc`** (required): Human-readable description of what the keymap does
- **`source`** (optional): Source file reference (defaults to `"manually added"`)

#### Plugin Name Format

Use the plugin name without the GitHub username (e.g., `"telescope.nvim"` not `"nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim"`). The keymaps will be automatically grouped with other keymaps from the same plugin.

#### Example Use Case: Telescope

Telescope pickers have a lot of built in keymaps that you might want to include in the cheatsheet, so if you wanted to include some or all of those you could add something like this to your config:
```lua
manual_keymaps = {
    ["telescope.nvim"] = {
        -- Built in telescope keymaps
        { keymap = "<Down>", mode = "i", desc = "Next item", source = "Built in telescope default" },
        { keymap = "<Up>", mode = "i", desc = "Previous item", source = "Built in telescope default" },
        { keymap = "<C-/>", mode = "i", desc = "Show mappings for picker actions", source = "Built in telescope default" },
        { keymap = "<C-u>", mode = "i", desc = "Scroll up in preview window", source = "Built in telescope default" },
        { keymap = "<C-d>", mode = "i", desc = "Scroll down in preview window", source = "Built in telescope default" },
        { keymap = "<C-q>", mode = "i", desc = "Send all items not filtered to quickfixlist", source = "Built in telescope default" },
        -- ...etc
    }
}
```

## Usage

### Generate Cheatsheet

```vim
:CheatsheetGenerate
```

Or in Lua:

```lua
require("cheatsheet_generator").generate()
```

### Install Pre-commit Hook

The plugin includes a convenient command to install a pre-commit hook that automatically generates the cheatsheet when you commit. This is especially useful for Neovim configuration repositories where you want to keep the cheatsheet up-to-date automatically.

#### Installation Command

Run this command from within your Neovim configuration repository:

```vim
:CheatsheetInstallHook
```

Or in Lua:

```lua
require("cheatsheet_generator").install_hook()
```

#### What the Hook Does

This command will:
- **Detect your git repository** - Works in any git repository (like your nvim config repo)
- **Handle custom Neovim configs** - Automatically detects and configures for `NVIM_APPNAME` setups
- **Copy the pre-commit hook** to `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
- **Make it executable** with proper permissions
- **Automatically generate the cheatsheet** on every commit
- **Add the updated cheatsheet to the commit** if it changed
- **Warn but not fail** if cheatsheet generation fails (so commits aren't blocked)

#### Requirements

- Must be run from within a git repository
- The repository should contain your Neovim configuration files
- Git must be available in your PATH

The hook will automatically work with both standard Neovim configs and custom `NVIM_APPNAME` configurations.

### Manual Git Hook Setup

If you prefer to set up the git hook manually:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
nvim --headless -c "lua require('cheatsheet_generator').generate_with_context('pre-commit')" -c "qa"
git add CHEATSHEET.md
```

## Keymap Detection

The plugin detects keymaps from multiple sources:

1. **Built-in Neovim defaults** - Standard Vim/Neovim keymaps
2. **Custom configuration** - Your personal keymaps from config files
3. **Plugin specifications** - Keymaps defined in lazy.nvim plugin specs
4. **Runtime keymaps** - Dynamically created keymaps from running plugins
5. **Filetype plugins** - Language-specific keymaps from ftplugin files

## Output Format

The generated cheatsheet includes:

- **Mode Legend** - Explanation of mode abbreviations
- **Categorized Tables** - Keymaps grouped by function or plugin
- **Source Links** - Direct links to source files with line numbers (GitHub)
- **Descriptions** - Human-readable descriptions for each keymap
